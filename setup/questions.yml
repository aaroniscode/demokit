        demo-kit uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create demo environments and
        launch and manage compute (ec2) instances. If you have multiple AWS accounts
        you may want to use a named profile. Most users will have setup a `default`
        profile and can use that.

        NOTE: For all the questions, you can press ENTER to accept the suggested
        answer in the brackets like [default] below.

        AWS profile?
      default: default

    - name: setup_aws_region
      private: no
      prompt: |

        demo-kit launches and manages compute (ec2) instances in a single AWS region.
        You can always later change this setting and re-run the configure script to
        change the region.

        AWS region?
      default: "us-east-1"

    - name: setup_aws_domain
      private: no
      prompt: |

        demo-kit uses AWS Route 53 to automatically assign DNS names to ec2 instances
        when they are launched. This requires a Hosted Zone already setup in Route 53.
        Please make sure you have a Hosted Zone configured before you launch instances.

        Domain name?
      default: example.com

    - name: setup_owner_tag
      private: no
      prompt: |

        demo-kit tags all AWS resources with `Owner` and `Project` tags to track
        deployed resources. Unlike Terraform, Ansible is not stateful and needs a
        dynamic way to keep track of resources. The `Project` tag defaults to `demokit`
        and can be changed in the `answers.yml` file. The `Owner` tag can also be used
        to track AWS usage and can assist with cost accounting. It is recommended to use
        your AWS username.

        Owner tag?
      default: firstname.lastname

    - name: setup_ssh_private_key
      private: no
      prompt: |

        demo-kit uses SSH Public Key Authentication to manages Linux instances. This
        requires a public/private keypair. AWS adds the public key to the `authorized_keys`
        file on the linux instance. Ansible uses the private key to connect, manage and
        configure the instance.

        SSH Private key?
      default: ~/.ssh/id_rsa

    - name: setup_ssh_public_key
      private: no
      prompt: |

        SSH Public key?
      default: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    - name: setup_windows_password
      private: no
      prompt: |

        For Windows instances, demo-kit uses Amazon provided AMI's which generate random
        Windows Administrator passwords on launch. demo-kit uses a powershell script at
        launch to configure WinRM and change the Administrator password. It is critical
        that you choose a password that meets Windows minimum complexity requirements.
        If it doesn't, the password fail to change without any apparent error.

        Windows Administrator Password?
      default: ChangeMePlease!

    - name: setup_docker_ee_url
      private: no
      prompt: |

        demo-kit will install Docker EE and requires a valid Docker EE subscription URL.
        The sample URL below is not valid. If you would like a trial subscription, you
        can request one at: https://store.docker.com/editions/enterprise/docker-ee-trial

        Docker EE URL?
      default: https://storebits.docker.com/ee/linux/sub-abcedf12-abcd-abcd-abcd-abcdef123456
